## Purpose

Help myself stay organized and prep for the interview in the future. My sense is praticing data structure and algorithm is always a good practice to improve one's programming skills since it is intellectually challenging and rewarding. I plan to participate some coding contest in the future as a hobby. This is just a start :)
